# Upgrad-Clone

UpGrad is a India's largest online higher education company. The main consumer base of this website are working professionals and students. We tried to clone the UpGrad website from the scratch. For this, We have used the HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 


## Appendix

We also implemented some functionalities like Carousal, Forms, Pop-up's etc.  


## How to use 

For using this code in your own system, firstly you have to clone this file into your local system. After that open it with any text Editor. There are seperate folders for CSS, images, Popups HTML, videos etc. Our main Page(landing page) of this website is named as upgrade_clone_merged. So, to view the project website on browser you have to run that landing page. Make sure that you open the whole upgrade folder from text editor(eg. - VS Code).
From the navbar of landing page, there are three more pages on which you can go. The three pages are - 1.) Refer and Earn, 2 Hire from upgrad & 3.) Short videos.

Also above footer on the landing page, there is a button named as 'View all free courses'. When you click on that button you will be redirect to our course section page from which you can select python course. After selecting python course, Some popups appear and ask for your basic details. This details will be stored in the local storage. After that you will redirect to the homepage of the python course and there are three pages of the pyhton Course i.e, 1.)Welcome to upstart 2.)Session Overview & 3.)Course Structure.
